# mo65x
stands for My Own 65 eXpandable emulator. The project has educational motivation and is a genuine project based on technical specifications of 6502/6510 family microprocessors. See the screenshot of assembler mode running slightly modified program "demoscene.asm" from http://www.6502asm.com

This branch is used for the step-by-step transition from Qt to the other cross-platform GUI library with more stable, free licensing model.
